# Overview
This CV is an exercise repository for Code Institute. It uses basic Html, Css and Boostrap.

# Objective
On this CV we aim at focusing on the visual balance aspect, highlighting the informations
that a recruiter might be more interested into, and we want to give the option to go in depth with more informations if the viewer is interested to.

To do that we have to keep in mind the different planes of UX and how are they applied even on a basic product like a CV.

#### What is an "UX plane"?
Jesse James Garrett has represented in 5 levels the design process of the UXD, and he called them "planes":
* Strategy Plane
* Scope Plane
* Structure Plane 
* Skeleton Plane
* Surface Plane
